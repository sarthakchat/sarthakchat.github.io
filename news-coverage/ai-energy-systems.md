Dr. Sarthak Chaturvedi, a Staff Scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, recently discussed the transformative role of Artificial Intelligence in optimizing energy systems. In an interview with Tech Daily, Dr. Chaturvedi highlighted how AI algorithms are being employed to predict energy demand, improve grid stability, and enhance the integration of renewable energy sources.

"AI is not just a buzzword in the energy sector," Dr. Chaturvedi explained. "It's a powerful tool that's helping us tackle some of the most pressing challenges in energy sustainability and efficiency."

The article goes on to detail specific projects at PNNL where AI is being utilized, including a machine learning model that predicts optimal times for charging electric vehicles to minimize grid stress and maximize the use of renewable energy.

Dr. Chaturvedi also emphasized the importance of responsible AI development, noting that as these technologies become more integrated into critical infrastructure, ensuring their reliability, security, and fairness becomes paramount.

This coverage in Tech Daily underscores the cutting-edge work being conducted at PNNL and highlights Dr. Chaturvedi's role in advancing the application of AI in energy systems.
