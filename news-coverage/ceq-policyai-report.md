üèõÔ∏è CEQ Report Highlight: The PolicyAI initiative, to which I contribute as a key team member, was featured in a report by the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) on modernizing environmental reviews through technology.

üîç Key Mention: The report noted that 'The Department of Energy announced $13 million in funding to build AI-powered tools to improve siting and permitting of clean energy infrastructure and has partnered with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to develop PolicyAI, a policy-specific large language model test bed that will be used to develop software to augment NEPA and related reviews.'

This inclusion in the CEQ report underscores the significance of PolicyAI in the broader context of the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of federal permitting processes. The recognition of PolicyAI in this report highlights its potential to enhance environmental reviews and accelerate clean energy infrastructure development.

The report emphasizes how PolicyAI aligns with the administration's goals of leveraging technology to modernize environmental reviews, increase transparency, and improve public accessibility in federal permitting processes.
