title: "Attending AI+Energy Summit"
---

I'm excited to announce that I'll be attending the AI + Energy Summit on September 26, 2024, in Washington, D.C. This event, organized by the Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP), will bring together leaders in policy, research, and industry to explore the crucial intersection of AI and energy innovation. It's a fantastic opportunity to discuss how abundant, low-cost energy can maintain U.S. competitive advantages in AI.
