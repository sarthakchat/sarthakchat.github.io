Sarthak is a Staff Scientist at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), leading the development of cutting-edge AI solutions for complex challenges in energy and environmental domain. His work focuses on advancing natural language processing applications in scientific and policy domains, with emphasis on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and novel architectures for domain-specific language understanding.

At PNNL, Sarthak collaborates with the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), and the Office of Policy to advance high-potential, high-impact energy technologies and supporting data-driven policymaking. His recent work on AI-powered environmental permitting has been recognized in the White House briefing on AI actions and the Department of Energy's new actions in AI announcement. This work has also inspired proposed legislation to boost AI applications in federal permitting processes.

Sarthak holds a graduate degree in Computational Science and Engineering from Georgia Tech. His research on equity in public EV charging infrastructure, supported by the National Science Foundation and Microsoft, applied generative AI approaches to address critical challenges in energy and transportation infrastructure. He has collaborated with researchers from Stanford University, TU Delft, University of Cambridge, and the Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and AI on various energy and sustainability projects.

His work has been presented at prestigious venues including AAAI, TADA, Transportation Research Group, and APPAM. Looking ahead, Sarthak envisions his work continuing to emphasize the application of AI-driven insights to policy analysis and decision support in strategically vital technological domains, furthering the impact of AI in addressing critical national and global challenges.
