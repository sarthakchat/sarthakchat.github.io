Sarthak is a Staff Scientist at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), spearheading the development of advanced AI solutions for complex challenges in energy and environmental domains. His work primarily focuses on natural language processing applications, with particular emphasis on developing state-of-the-art Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) models and domain-specific language understanding architectures. Sarthak's recent work includes developing a state-of-the-art embedding model for environmental law compliance during project permitting, significantly improving the permitting process for critical clean energy initiatives.

At PNNL, Sarthak collaborates across multiple Department of Energy offices, including the Office of Policy, Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), and Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), to advance high-impact energy technologies and support data-driven policymaking. His projects span crucial areas including sustainable transportation planning, national decarbonization strategies, and power grid analysis, contributing to challenges in critical energy and environmental sectors. Sarthak's work on PolicyAI and environmental permitting has been recognized in White House briefings and Department of Energy announcements, inspiring proposed legislation to boost AI applications in federal processes.
