üîã Study Overview: This research demonstrates the use of large language models (LLMs) to evaluate online consumer reviews associated with EV charging stations.

üîç Key Findings: 
- Achieved 92.00% classification accuracy and 0.931 F1 score with GPT-3
- GPT-4 attained comparable performance without any training examples
- LLMs enable examination of evolving pricing schemes on consumer sentiment

This study showcases the potential of LLMs in analyzing consumer behavior in the rapidly growing EV charging market. By leveraging AI to process unstructured consumer data, it provides a cost-effective method for policymakers to gain real-time insights into pricing impacts and emerging business models in the clean energy transition.
