ðŸš— Study Overview: This research proposes a methodology to estimate traffic conditions on urban arterials using DSRC-based mobile sensors in probe vehicles.

ðŸ“Š Key Findings:
- Nearest leader/follower method better emulated real-time speed estimation
- Pearson Correlation coefficient for speed estimation: 0.8752 (Farthest method), 0.9269 (Nearest method)
- RMSPE for travel time estimation: 14.61% (Farthest method), 16.56% (Nearest method)

This study demonstrates the potential of using DSRC-enabled probe vehicles for real-time traffic state estimation, which could improve traffic management systems and congestion identification.
