Publication: 2023 APPAM Fall Research Conference
Date: November 9, 2023

üîå Study Overview: This research demonstrates how large language models (LLMs) can be used to analyze consumer responses to electric vehicle (EV) charging pricing schemes, providing valuable insights for policymakers.

üîç Key Findings:
- Utilized zero and few-shot learning capabilities of GPT-4 and GPT-3 to classify consumer responses
- Achieved high accuracy in sentiment classification with minimal training data
- Enabled real-time assessment of charging infrastructure and emerging business models

This study showcases the potential of AI in providing policymakers with timely and cost-effective insights into consumer behavior in the rapidly evolving EV charging market. By leveraging LLMs, the research offers a novel approach to understanding how pricing impacts consumer adoption of clean energy technologies.
