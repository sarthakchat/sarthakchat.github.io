ðŸš¦ Study Overview: This paper proposes two clustering-based methods for traffic data imputation to address issues of missing data in transportation management systems.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings:
- Speed bin method was more effective with a maximum MAPE of 13.8%
- K-means clustering method had a maximum MAPE of 22.6%
- These methods can help ensure the integrity and quality of traffic data

This research contributes to enhancing the reliability of Intelligent Transportation Systems by addressing the challenge of missing data in traffic monitoring.
